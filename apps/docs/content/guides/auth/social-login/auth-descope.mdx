To enable Descope for your project, you need to use the default Descope OIDC Application and add your Descope Project ID and Descope Access Key to your Supabase Dashboard.

## Overview

In this guide, we will cover how to use Supabase OAuth with Descope to implement Single-Sign-On(SSO).

The procedure consists of five broad steps:

- Create a new Project in Descope.
- Obtain the `Project ID` from the [Project Settings](https://app.descope.com/settings/project) page.
- Create and obtain the `Access Key` from the [Access Keys](https://app.descope.com/accesskeys) page.
- Add your Descope Project ID and Access Key into your Supabase project

## Create a Descope Project

Either [Sign Up](https://www.descope.com/sign-up) for a Descope account, or login to your [Descope Console](https://app.descope.com) if you already have an account.

## Obtain your Descope Project ID

In order to use Descope as an OAuth Provider, you'll need your Descope Project ID. You can find this in the Descope Console, underneath [Project Settings](https://app.descope.com/settings/project).

## Create and Obtain your Descope Access Key

Head over to the [Access Keys](https://app.descope.com/accesskeys) page and create a new Access Key.

When your user signs in, call [signInWithOAuth()](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signinwithoauth) with `descope` as the `provider`:

```js
async function signInWithWorkOS() {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
    provider: 'descope',
    options: {
      queryParams: {
        connection: '<your_connection>',
        organization: '<your_organization',
        workos_provider: '<your_provider>',
      },
    },
  })
}
```

Refer to the [Descope Documentation](https://workos.com/docs/reference/sso/authorize/) to learn more about the different methods.

When your user signs in, call [signInWith(Provider)](/docs/reference/kotlin/auth-signinwithoauth) with `WorkOS` as the `Provider`:

```kotlin

		queryParams["connection"] = "<your_connection>"
		queryParams["organization"] = "<your_organization>"

When your user signs out, call [signOut()](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signout) to remove them from the browser session and any objects from localStorage:

```js
async function signOut() {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut()
}
