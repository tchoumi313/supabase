<Admonition type="note">

PgBouncer is being deprecated in favor of Supavisor. Supavisor is available on all new and existing projects.

On 15th January 2024 PgBouncer will be disabled.

Additionally, your Supabase database domain (db.projectref.supabase.co) will start resolving to an IPv6 address.

No changes are required if your network supports communicating via IPv6. Otherwise, update your applications to use Supavisor which will continue to support IPv4 connections.

[Full details here](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/17817).

</Admonition>

Supavisor is a connection pooler by Supabase. It can provide a more scalable connection pool than PgBouncer, and runs on a high-availability cluster segregated from your database.

Using a clustered connection pooler can free up some CPU cycles for your database to use for queries. It also makes connecting to Postgres in a serverless environment much easier.

## PgBouncer Compatability

Supavisor is compatible with with PgBouncer pool modes. Application changes will not be required to switch from PgBouncer to Supavisor.

## Migrating to Supavisor

When a project is switched from PgBouncer to Supavisor, the appropriate connection string will be made available under the Connection Pooling section on [Database settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/database).

While PgBouncer remains accessible for use, it will no longer be available for configuration from the dashboard. The PgBouncer connection string will also be similarly inaccessible from the dashboard.
