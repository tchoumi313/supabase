import Layout from '~/layouts/DefaultGuideLayout'

Storage's role-based access control can dynamically adjust to the role specified in the incoming authorization header. By default, it supports:

- **anon**: For unauthenticated access.
- **authenticated**: For standard user access.
- **service_role**: For-server side access.

For applications where JWTs contain custom roles, Storage can be configured to recognize and switch to these roles for finer-grained permission control.

## Custom Role Setup

Define a Custom Role
Create roles as per your application's needs. Example:

```sql
CREATE ROLE "manager";
```

#### Assign Permissions

Grant necessary permissions so that Storage can switch to this role

```sql
GRANT manager TO authenticator;
GRANT anon TO manager;
```
